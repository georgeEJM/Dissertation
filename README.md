# Dissertation
My third year dissertation/personal project
This is my third year dissertation, for which I earnt a 79/100. It demonstrates how convolutional neural networks can be used to artificially apply colour to greyscale images.

Sadly I can't upload the weights for the final network, as they exceed the file size limit. :(
